Service
======
* I am a bone marrow donor. I strongly advise to everybody to do the same. You can find all the information you need in [ADMO site](https://admo.it/).
* I am a blood donor. Same as before: I strongly advise everybody to do it. Do not fear the needle, it does not hurt; the donation lasts five minutes. You can find all the information in one of the many blood donor associations like [AVIS](https://www.avis.it/it).
