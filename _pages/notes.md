This is a local dump for notes that I've collected over the years. I don't promise that they are good or even useful, it's just a way for me to have the organized somewhere! Take everything with a grain of salt.

## [A General and Fast Introduction to the Standard Model](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/notes_SM.pdf)
These are some general notes on the basics of the Standard Model: starting from the Electroweak sector and going into the dynamics of the Higgs mechanism and spontaneous symmetry breaking. We go into the details of the Flavour structure of the SM with the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix and the related CP-violation.

The second chapter deals with the perturbative dynamics of the strong sector of the SM where we evaluate the $1$-loop beta function, the renormalization group equations and asymptotic freedom.

## [Electroweak Interactions in the SM](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/EW_Notes.pdf)
These are some notes I wrote for a course given in Sapienza University by prof. Guido Martinelli on Electroweak Interactions. There could be errors inside, I've never checked them back.

## [Notes on Equivariant Localization](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/equiv_loc.pdf)
These are notes of the IHES school on "Supersymmetric Localization and Exact Results" given by F. Benini
