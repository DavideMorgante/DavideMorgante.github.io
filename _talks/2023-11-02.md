Spindles provide an interesting geometry for studying compactifications, where supersymmetry is preserved in a non-trivial way. In this talk I will give a review of my recent work on the effective 2d SCFTs living on M5-branes wrapped on product geometry of a Riemann surface with a Spindle. We provide a check of the AdS/CFT correspondence for these theories by matching the 2d central charge from the anomaly polynomial with the one found from the supergravity solution.
