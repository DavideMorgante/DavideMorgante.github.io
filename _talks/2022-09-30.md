General talk for PhD students on recent developements of supersymmetric dualities in three dimensions. In particular, I discussed the results we obtained for chiral SQCD-like theories with Chern-Simmons levels in three dimensions obtained by real mass flow from non-chiral theories. These theories also had tensor matter which interacted through a $D$-type superpotential $W=\text{Tr} X Y^2+\text{Tr} X^{n+1}$. The dualitied were checked by means equivariant localization on the squashed $3$-sphere partition function.
