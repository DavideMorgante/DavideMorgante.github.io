Here you can find the various notes of the lectures with the exercises presented during the lessons plus some other exercises that I didn't have time to do in class. Most of the notes come with some basic theory behind the exercises themselves.

The lectures are held in presence in the following days

| Day       | Time            | Classroom                             |
| --------  | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Monday    |  16.30-18       | Aula D                                |
| Thursday  |  16.30-18       | Aula I                                |

I strongly recommend to follow the lectures in class so that you can ask me any question directly. For any other questions related to exercises, done and not done during the lecture, you can contact Me or Andrea Barontini at the following e-mail addresses

* Davide Morgante: davide.morgante@mi.infn.it
* Andrea Barontini: andrea.barontini@unimi.it

We organized also the following *office hours*, where the students can come and ask us questions

| Day       | Time            | Office                                |
| --------  | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Wednesday |  10.30-11.30    | LITA - BO.DO 06                       |      

Before coming to the office hours, please send us an e-mail to know.

My office, DC/T/37, is located at the ground floor, at the end of the central corridor to the left, near the bathrooms (the office is two doors from prof. Molinari's office).

Andrea's office, BO.DO 06, is located at the 2th floor of the LITA building same corridor of Aula Polvani.
