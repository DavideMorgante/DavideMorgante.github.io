Here you can find the various notes of the lectures with the exercises presented during the lessons plus some other exercises that I didn't have time to do in class. Most of the notes come with some basic theory behind the exercises themselves.

The lectures are held in presence in the following days

| Day       | Time            | Classroom                             |
| --------  | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Monday    |  16.30-18       | Aula D                                |
| Thursday  |  16.30-18       | Aula I                                |

I strongly recommend to follow the lectures in class so that you can ask me any question directly. For any other questions related to exercises, done and not done during the lecture, you can contact Me or Andrea Barontini at the following e-mail addresses

* Davide Morgante: davide.morgante@mi.infn.it
* Andrea Barontini: andrea.barontini@unimi.it

We organized also the following *office hours*, where the students can come and ask us questions

| Day       | Time            | Office                                |
| --------  | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Wednesday |  10.30-11.30    | LITA - BO.DO 06                       |      

Before coming to the office hours, please send us an e-mail to know. If you need to come outside office hours, send me (Davide) and e-mail and we can organize something 

My office, DC/T/37, is located at the ground floor, at the end of the central corridor to the left, near the bathrooms (the office is two doors from prof. Molinari's office).

Andrea's office, BO.DO 06, is located at the 2th floor of the LITA building same corridor of Aula Polvani.

## Lecture 1 & 2: Complex differentiability, Holomorphic functions, Harmonic functions (18-21/03/24)
You can find the pdf of the lesson by Andrea from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione1.pdf).
Next lecture we are going to do similar exercises for the students that couldn't follow this lesson due to the laboratory course.

You can find the pdf of my lesson at [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione1_3.pdf). The exercise of the differential equation can be found [here](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione1_2.pdf).

## Lecture 3 & 4: Line integrals in the complex plane (25/03/24 & 04/04/24)
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Integrali_1.pdf). The last exercise we didn't do in class.

Andrea did the same exercises of the previous link plus the first one that you can find from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Metodi23/5-04-23_Frigerio.pdf). Here you can find a couple more exercises from last year.

## Lecture 5:Taylor and Laurent series, Radius of convergence, Cayley-Hamilton theorem for the power of a matrix (25/03/24)

In the following weeks we are going to study in great details the properties of power expansions for holomorphic and meromorphic functions. This is a very relevant topic of this course, so I recommend coming to the tutoring classes.
