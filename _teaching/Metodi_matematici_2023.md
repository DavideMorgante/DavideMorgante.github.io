Here you can find the various notes of the lectures with the exercises presented during the lessons plus some other exercises that I didn't have time to do in class. Most of the notes come with some basic theory behind the exercises themselves.

The lectures are held in presence in the following days

| Day       | Time            | Classroom                             |
| --------  | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Monday    |  17-18          | Aula C                                |
| Wednesday |  17-18          | Aula C                                |

I strongly recommend to follow the lectures in class so that you can ask me any question directly. For any other questions related to exercises, done and not done during the lecture, you can contact Me or Massimo Frigerio at the following e-mail addresses

* Davide Morgante: davide.morgante@mi.infn.it
* Massimo Frigerio: massimo.frigerio@unimi.it

We organized also the following *office hours*, where the students can come and ask us questions

| Day       | Time            | Office                                |
| --------  | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Monday    |  14.30-15.30    | Davide - DC/T/37                      |
| Wednesday |  10.30-11.30    | Massimo - BO.DO 06                    |      


To have an appointment outside the office hours, just send us an e-mail!

My office, DC/T/37, is located at the ground floor, at the end of the central corridor to the left, near the bathrooms (the office is two doors from prof. Molinari's office).

Massimo's office, BO.DO 06, is located at the 5th floor of the LITA building.

<span style="color:red">N.B. I'm not going to be in Unimi up to the 15th June, so if you need to meet me or ask me question, you can send me an e-mail and we can orginese a zoom meeting. The rest of the lessons are going to be given by Massimo! If needed, we'll organise more tutoring classes when I'm back.</span>

## Lecture 1: Complex differentiability, Holomorphic functions, Harmonic functions pt. 1 (27/03/23)
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione1.pdf).
Next lecture we are going to do similar exercises for the students that couldn't follow this lesson due to the laboratory course.

The second exercise solved by using differential equation techniques is [here](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione1_2.pdf).

## Lecture 2: Complex differentiability, Holomorphic functions, Harmonic functions pt. 2 (29/03/23)
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione1_3.pdf). The first exercise is in the pdf of the first lesson.

## Lecture 3: Line integrals in the complex plane pt.1 (03/04/23)
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Integrali_1.pdf). The last exercise we didn't do in class.

## Lecture 4: Line integrals in the complex plane pt.2 (05/04/23)
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/es_METODI_5_04_23_Frigerio.pdf).
