Here you can find the various notes of the lectures with the exercises presented during the lessons plus some other exercises that I didn't have time to do in class. Most of the notes come with some basic theory behind the exercises themselves.

The lectures are held both online and in presence in the following days

| Day       | Time            | Classroom                             |
| --------  | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| TBA       |    |  |
| TBA       |    |  |

I strongly recommend to follow the lectures in class so that you can ask me any question directly. For any other questions related to exercises, done and not done during the lecture, you can contact Me or Massimo Frigerio at the following e-mail addresses

* Davide Morgante: davide.morgante@mi.infn.it
* Massimo Frigerio: massimo.frigerio@unimi.it

We are going to organize some days for *office hours*, where the students can come and ask us questions. To have an appointment outside the office hours, just send us an e-mail!

The number of my office is DC/T/37 and is located at the ground floor, at the end of the central corridor to the left, near the bathrooms (the office is two doors from prof. Molinari's office).

Massimo's office is number BO.DO 06, located at the 5th floor of the LITA building.
