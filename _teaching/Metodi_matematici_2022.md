Here you can find the various notes of the lectures with the exercises presented during the lessons plus some other exercises that I didn't have time to do in class. Most of the notes come with some basic theory behind the exercises themselves.

The lectures are held both online and in presence in the following days

| Day       | Time            | Classroom                             |
| --------  | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Monday    | 16.30 - 17.30   | Aula C (usual Zoom link and password) |
| Thursday  | 16.30 - 17.30   | Aula B (usual Zoom link and password) |

I strongly recommend to follow the lectures in class so that you can ask me any question directly. For any other questions related to exercises, done and not done during the lecture, you can contact Me or Marco Marino ad the following e-mail addresses

* Davide Morgante: davide.morgante@mi.infn.it
* Marco Marino: marco.marino1@unimi.it

The number of my office is DC/T/37 and is located at the ground floor, at the end of the central corridor to the left, near the bathrooms (the office is two doors from prof. Molinari's office). For the location of Marco's office, write him an e-mail!

## Lecture 1: Complex differentiability, Holomorphic functions, Harmonic functions (04/04/21)
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione1.pdf)

## Lecture 2: Cauchy integral formula, Taylor and Laurent series, Radius of convergence, Cayley-Hamilton theorem for the power of a matrix (07/04/21)
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione2.pdf)

**Please Note:** There is an error in the solution of the Cayley-Hamilton exercise. I want to thank the students for making me notice it. You can find the right solution from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/CH_corretto.pdf)

## Lecture 3: More Taylor and Laurent series (11/04/21)
The second method to do the series expansion of $f(z) = (z^2-5z+4)^{-1}$ using Cauchy product formula, can be found in the lesson 2 [notes](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione2.pdf).

The notes for the big exercise done during class can be found from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione3.pdf)
