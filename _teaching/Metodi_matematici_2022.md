Here you can find the various notes of the lectures with the exercises presented during the lessons plus some other exercises that I didn't have time to do in class. Most of the notes come with some basic theory behind the exercises themselves.

#### Lecture 1: Complex differentiability, Holomorphic functions, Harmonic functions
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione1.pdf)

Lecture 2: Cauchy integral formula, Taylor and Laurent series, Radius of convergence, Cayley-Hamilton theorem for the exponential of a matrix
======
You can find the pdf of the lesson from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione2.pdf)

**Please Note:** There is an error in the solution of the Cayley-Hamilton exercise. I want to thank the students that make me notice it. You can find the right solution from [this link](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/CH_corretto.pdf)

Lecture 3: More Taylor and Laurent series
======
The second method to do the series expansion of $f(z) = (z^2-5z+4)^{-1}$ using Cauchy product formula, can be found in the lesson 2 [notes](http://DavideMorgante.github.io/files/Lezione2.pdf)
