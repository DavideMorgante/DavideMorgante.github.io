Abstract: Flavour mixing and CP violation as measured in weak decays and mixing of neutral mesons are a fundamental tool to test the Standard Model (SM) and to search for new physics. New analyses performed at the LHC experiment open an unprecedented insight into the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) metrology and new evidence for rare decays. Important progress has also been achieved in theoretical calculations of several hadronic quantities with a remarkable reduction of the uncertainties. This improvement is essential since previous studies of the Unitarity Triangle did show that possible contributions from new physics, if any, must be tiny and could easily be hidden by theoretical and experimental errors. Thanks to the experimental and theoretical advances, the CKM picture provides very precise SM predictions through global analyses. We present here the results of the latest global SM analysis performed by the UTfit collaboration including all the most updated inputs from experiments, lattice QCD and phenomenological calculations.
