excerpt: 'In this paper we study $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\text{(S)U}(N_c)_k$ chiral dualities and check them by matching the partition functions of the dual theories. A particular care is taken in evaluating the complex phase needed for the matching that can be recovered in field theory by studying the contact terms of 2-point functions for the abelian symmetries'

Abstract: We study dualities for $3d$ $\text{U}(N_{c})$ chiral SQCD with $D_{n+2}$-type superpotential, with $n$ odd. We give a complete classification of such dualities in terms of the number of fundamentals and anti-fundamentals and the Chern-Simons level. The classification is obtained by real mass and Higgs flows from non-chiral dualities and we check the consistency of the new non-chiral dualities at the level of the partition function. We we also check that the complex phases appearing in the integral identities between the partition functions are consistent with the contact terms computed as quantum corrections to the effective Chern-Simons level. The $\text{SU}(N_{c})$  cases are recovered by gauging the topological symmetry from the $\text{U}(N_{c})$ dualities. Finally, we consider the case of $\text{USp}(2N_{c})$ with two antisymmetric tensors and $D_{n+2}$-type superpotential.
